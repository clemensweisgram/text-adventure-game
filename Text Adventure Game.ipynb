    "The game displays a journey between planets in our solar system. Starting from the Earth, \\\n",
    "the traveler needs to make decisions where to go and ultimately return to Earth. On the journey \\\n",
    "multiple constraints need to be considered including the fuel consumption, the minimum of 3 planets \\\n",
    "to be visited and the path to be taken. The inputs that are required to move the game forward can \\\n",
    "be given in a variety of modes while maintaining playability of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known bugs:\n",
    "# - fuel calculation does not work correctly anymore if user takes the route to outer space more than \\\n",
    "once (not recommended). Bug can be fixed by adding more conditional statements that check for the \\\n",
    "entire path taken and not just like this code that checks only the immediately previous flight's \\\n",
    "fuel consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - if user takes the route Earth - Mars - Venus - Outer Space (automatically sent back to \\\n",
    "Mars) - Jupiter - Earth, the fail_early return (didn't visit 3 planets) is shown even though 3 \\\n",
    "were visited. Fix could be done by nesting an if function in option C at jupiter.choice that checks \\\n",
    "whether the user took the Outer Space route to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - line breaks in displayed text happen within words. Seems to be a Jupyter Notebook problem.\n",
